### Custom templates are not available in latest Android Studio.

Previously, template directory contained ftl files, but now templates are included in jar. Therefore, we cannot easily
add them. By the way, template is named `wizard-template.jar` and is under the `Android Studio.app/Contents/plugins/`.

# Android AAC Template
